# FAA-Analysis-SAS
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AVIATION (FAA) Data Analysis using SAS


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
The project aims to determine what factors affect the landing distance of a flight so that they can make better predictions to further enhance flight safety. We analyzed two datasets from the FAA using SAS. The data was cleaned up to make it suitable for analysis. The clean-up process including identifying and removing blank rows, duplicate rows, and abnormal values. Using data exploration and visualization we inferred key characteristics of the data. Using multiple linear regression, the data was modeled to find the influence of predictor variables on landing distance. The analysis found that the airspeed and height were the key variables that impact landing distance. As well it was found that the landing distance was dependent on the type of aircraft â€“ Boeing and Airbus.
